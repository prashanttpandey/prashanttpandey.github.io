Hi, Iâ€™m **Prashant Pandey**, An engineer with a Bachelor of Engineering in the field of Communication Engineering from Kathmandu University, specialized in Wireless Technologies and Electronics. Experienced in the fields of GSM network design and implementation, use of VLANs each of these being among the core issues about Advanced Communication Systems and Integration in IoT.

My professional journey so far has been marked by working on the optimization of telecom networks and contributing to the deployment of novel solutions, such as AI-powered imaging systems, while at GE Healthcare. Proficient in tools like MATLAB, Simulink, C/C++, Optisystem and Packet Tracer, I believe in designing and implementing highly innovative systems that bridge efficiency and connectivity. 

Hence, it holds immense promise for a prospective graduate study and research in Wireless and Optical Communications, IoT, and practical applications. My main aim is to utilize advanced technologies in solving the complex problems and making effective contributions towards the communication and electronics fields. I am currently interested in learning HDL and Machine learning.
